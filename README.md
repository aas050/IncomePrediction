# IncomePrediction

Our goal in our project was to see if we can build a classification on our data set from the census bureau database to predict if someone makes more than $50,000 per year. In this dataset, there was a column that said if the individual was making more or less than this income threshold a year, letting us use this data set as both a training set and a test set. With this suitable data set, we transformed most of our categorical data set into numerical data and imported and ran a random forest classifier. In the end, our final classifier had a 79% accuracy on our given dataset, showing us that our classifier is suitable with decent accuracy.
